## Share data files and other binary files over DropBox instead of GitHub
This best practice will be added to later with code example etc.
* Binary files not efficient to share over GitHub.
* If everyone with access to the GitHub also have access to the DropBox, then binary files can be read and saved directly to the DropBox folder and be ignored from the GitHub repository all together
* Then ignore all binary files in GitHub.

This solution only uses GitHub for what GitHub is best at and uses DropBox does everything else
