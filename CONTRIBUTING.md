# How to contribute:
If you are familiar with how GitHub works, please feel free to make a fork and submit a pull request for any additions you want to make. Skip to the [Pull-request contributions](#pull-request-contributions) if you are familiar with GitHub and want to do this.

## Bug reports and feature requests
An easy but still very efficient way to provide any feedback to this tutorial that does not require any GitHub knowledge is to create an *issue*. You can read *issues* submitted by other users or create a new *issue* [here](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/GitHubDropBox/issues). While the word *issue* has a negative connotation outside GitHub, it can be used for any kind of feedback. Please read already existing *issues* to check whether someone else has made the same suggestion or reported the same error before creating a new *issue*.

# Pull-request contributions
In addition to using common GitHub practices, please follow these conventions to make it possible to keep an overview of the progress made to the code in this toolkit.
